# LearnFusion_Weather-Dashboard
Developed a weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to enter a city name and displays detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML: Structured the user interface with input fields and weather display elements.
2. CSS: Styled the application for a user-friendly and responsive design.
3. JavaScript​: Implemented functionality to fetch data from the API, dynamically update the UI based on the weather conditions, and clear the input after displaying results.

Key Features:
▪ Dynamic Weather Display: Shows current weather conditions including temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, and wind speed in km/hr.
▪ Weather Icons: Dynamically updates the weather icon based on conditions such as Clouds, Clear, Rain, Drizzle, and Mist.
▪ User Interaction: Allows users to input any city worldwide to check its weather.

Personal Contribution:

▪ Enhanced user experience with responsive design principles and error handling for API requests.

Future Enhancements:
▪ Integration of more weather conditions and corresponding icons.
▪ Implementing geolocation to automatically fetch weather based on the user's location.
▪ Adding forecast functionality to display weather predictions for upcoming days.

Skills Demonstrated:
▪ Front-end Development (HTML, CSS).
